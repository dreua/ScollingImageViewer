# ScollingImageViewer
Present a big (in height) image to the audience via projector using HTML5, CSS and jQuery

[Check out the Demo!](https://dreua.github.io/ScollingImageViewer/)

Usage:

Hold <kbd>Space</kbd> for smooth scrolling, release at any time to stop.

For setup purposes:
- <kbd>W</kbd> scroll up
- <kbd>S</kbd> scroll down
- <kbd>T</kbd> curtain up
- <kbd>G</kbd> curtain down
- Combine these with <kbd>Shift</kbd> for bigger steps

Works best with full screen mode of your browser (usually <kbd>F11</kbd>)!

I added the "curtain" because our screen didn't fit the projector's aspect ratio. This way
the projector has an always black area at the top where the screen is not big enough.
